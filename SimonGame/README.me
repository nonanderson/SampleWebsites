The Simon Game is a sequence-based game with four squares on the screen. One square flashes, and the user clicks it. Another square flashes, the user clicks the previous square, then the most recent, etc. until there is a long chain of squares to click in the right order. If one of the squares clicked is not part of the original sequence, the user loses and has to restart. There is no end goal- just to continue the sequence.
