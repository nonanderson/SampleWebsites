The implementation of TinDog (a play on the popular dating app, Tinder) was assigned to the students of the 2022 Web Development Bootcamp
with the purpose of creating a concise, beautiful webpage for a startup. Alongside the implementation of BootStrap, custom CSS was also 
heavily utilized. In this module, we as students started off learning the fundamentals of BootStrap, eventually getting into more complex
components to add interactivity and functionality to the site. The module ended with a complete refactoring of all custom CSS with the
purpose of making the code clean and legible for all users who may want to look at the source of the site.
